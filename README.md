# POINT LIO

This is a light version of the Point LIO algorithm adapted to livox MID360 lidar for UAV deployment. See original repo with all installation instructions on https://github.com/hku-mars/Point-LIO. Note that in this repo we use https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver2 for compliance with the MID360.
